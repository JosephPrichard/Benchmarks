# Benchmarks

Benchmark of popular programming languages by solving the [sliding puzzle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) using the AStar algorithm.
Each implementation is guaranteed to find the shortest number of steps to solve any solvable NPuzzle. 

The sliding puzzle problem is a space-exploration problem involving list/array traversal, map/priority queue usage, copying, and lots of memory allocation. This makes it an effective way of benchmarking how efficient a programming language is.

Currently includes implementations for Java, C, C++, C#, Rust, Go, OCaml, Javascript, and Python. Many more to come - implementing a sliding puzzle solver has become my primary way to learn a new language. 

# Usage
Any puzzle solver executable can be invoked with a command line argument. The command line argument is a path to a file containing newline seperated puzzles to solve.
An example of how valid puzzle files look like n=are in the files `8puzzles-*.txt` and `15puzzles-*.txt`. Random puzzle file inputs can be generated in `PuzzleGenerator.java` in the java implementation.

An example 3x3 puzzle input looks like so
```
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8
```

A 4x4 like so
```
0 1 2 3
4 5 6 7
8 9 10 11
12 13 14 15
```

A legal puzzle input must contain a 0 representing the empty space, a space between each column, and a newline between rows. Nonzero tiles can be any integers but the program isn't guaranteed to find the shortest path (or any path) nonconventional puzzles. Generally nonzero tiles for a legal puzzle are numbers `1:(N*N-1)`. `N` being the dimension of the puzzle. An 8puzzle would contain integers `1:8` and a 15puzzle integers `1:15` in any order.

# Usage

Build the programs using the Makefile.

```shell
$ make
```

Run the benchmarks using the `run-bench.sh` script.

```shell
$ ./run-bench.sh 8puzzles-small.txt
```

Additionally, you can generate new puzzle inputs using the `./run-generate.sh` script. This is reccomended over making your inputs by hand.

```shell
$ ./run-graph.sh
```
