# SlidingPuzzle C
AI written in C to solve the [sliding puzzle_t problem](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle/specification.php) using the AStar algorithm. This AI is guaranteed to find the shortest number of steps to solve any solvable 8Puzzle. 

I'm working on a variety of optimizations including better heuristics, 3-heap, and robinhood hash tables.
